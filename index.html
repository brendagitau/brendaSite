    <h1>WHAT IS A BOX MODEL IN CSS?</h1>
    <p> 
        <br> The box model in CSS is a set of rules that determine how your web page is rendered on the internet. <br>
        In this model, a rectangular box is generated for HTML elements. Each is laid out according to their 
        <br>dimension, type, positioning, relationship to other elements, and external factors like viewport size. 
        <br>This box consists of content, padding, a border, and margin.
        It can be used as a toolkit for customizing the layout of different elements.
    </p>
    <p> Hereâ€™s an example that illustrates each layer of the CSS box model. We'll be discussing these layers. </p>

<h2>Box Model Properties</h2>
<p>Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. Some of them are given below:<br>
    <br> In CSS every element is seen as a box.Whether text, image ,title ,button etc. We will be using  the analogy of a house to explain the properties of the box model in CSS.<br>

    <h3>1.) Borders</h3>

    This is the "fence" in our analogy.It seperates us form other external enviroments yet adds to the size of our property.
   <br>So in css it shows where an elements begins and ends i.e its"personal space".Its width still adds to the the total width of our  element .<br><br>
   
   <h3> 2.) Margins</h3>

   This is the space between one element and other elements e.g one button and another.Whatever size of margin is not  included in the total size of the element.
   Margins collapse between two elements that are next to one another.This means that if the margin in element A is 12px and element B is 40 px,<br>
   then the distance between the 2 elements will be 40 px. That is the distance between one "house" and another. <br>
   
   <h3>3.) Content</h3>

   This is where the content of your element lives e.g text , nested elements etc.<br>
   Ths is the "house" and width and height properties are applied to the content area by default or manually in css.<br><br>
   
   <h3>4.) Padding</h3>
    
   This is the space between the content of the element and the border of the element.So its the "lawn" or the area around our house.
   <br> Its the area between the actual house and the fence.The values for padding are set with the padding property.These values increase the overall width and height of
   our element in addition to the  height and width set to the  content area.<br><br>
   
  
   <h3> 5.)Box-sizing</h3>
   The CSS box-sizing property is used to adjust or control the size of any element that accepts a width or height . 
   It specifies how to calculate the total width and height of that element.
  It  handy when its time to calculate the total dimention of a box, especially when you dont want an element to exeed a certain size.<br> <br>

</p>
<h2>Calculating The Dimentions Of a Box Model. </h2><br>
<P>By default, the CSS box model calculates any element that accepts a width or height in this format:-<br>
<br>
    a.) width + padding + border = rendered or displayed width of the element's box.<br><br>
   b.)  height + padding + border = rendered or displayed height of the element's box.<br><br>
    This means that whenever you add padding or border to the element, the size of an element will appear bigger than the size originally assigned to it.<br> This is because the content of that element includes the width and height properties but does not include the padding or border property.<br><br>
    
    </P>
    <h4>for example</h4>
    <p>Below are the dimentions of  a random box model:-<br><br></p>
       <p2> .first-box {<br>
        width: 200px;<br>
        height: 100px;<br>
        border: 8px solid blue;<br>
        padding: 20px;<br>
        background: yellow;<br>
        /* Total width: 200px + (2 * 20px) + (2 * 8px) = 256px<br>
           Total height: 100px + (2 * 20px) + (2 * 8px) = 156px */<br>
      }<br><br>

      The total width of an element should be calculated like this:<br>

Total element width = width + left padding + right padding + left border + right border + left margin + right margin<br>

The total height of an element should be calculated like this:<br>

Total element height = height + top padding + bottom padding + top border + bottom border + top margin + bottom margin<br>
    </p2>
    <p>With the above  knowledge you will be able to know how much space your element will occupy</p>
